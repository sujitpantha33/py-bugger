"""Utilities for introducing specific kinds of bugs.

DEV: Don't rush to refactor bugger functions. for example, it's not yet clear whether this should
be a class. Also, not sure we need separate bugger functions, or one bugger function with some
conditional logic. Implement support for another exception type, and logical errors, and see what
things are looking like.
